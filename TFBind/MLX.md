### Description

This script uses the MLX framework by importing the necessary modules (`mlx.core`, `mlx.nn`, and `mlx.optimizers`). The MLX library is designed to leverage GPU acceleration, and its API is often similar to PyTorch but with some differences. Here's the updated script using MLX:
`CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-arm64 conda create -n AppleMLX python=3.11`

### Explanation:

1. **MLX Imports**:

   - The script now imports modules from `mlx.core`, `mlx.nn`, and `mlx.optimizers` to use MLX's framework for GPU-accelerated computation.

2. **Tensor Operations**:

   - The tensor operations have been changed to use MLX's tensor operations (`mx.tensor`, `mx.stack`, etc.) instead of PyTorch's.

3. **Device Handling**:

   - The script checks for GPU support using `mx.device("gpu")` and defaults to `cpu` if unavailable. This ensures that MLX's GPU capabilities are used where applicable.

4. **Optimizer**:

   - The optimizer is now `mlx.optimizers.Adam`, which aligns with the MLX framework.

5. **Softmax and Multinomial**:

   - Functions like `mx.softmax` and `mx.multinomial` are used in place of their PyTorch equivalents.

6. **Logging and Plotting**:
   - Metrics such as loss, number of modes, and diversity are logged and then plotted using `matplotlib`, as in the original version of the script.

### Running the Script:

- To run this script on your MacBook M1 with MLX, you need to ensure that the MLX framework is properly installed and that it recognizes the GPU (MPS). If everything is set up correctly, this script should run efficiently using GPU acceleration.

Here’s how you can integrate WANDB (Weights & Biases) for visualizing the training metrics such as loss, number of modes, and diversity. The code will log all these metrics directly to WANDB during training, making it easy to track and visualize.

### Explanation:

1. **WANDB Initialization**:

   - `wandb.init()` is called to initialize the WANDB project. The configuration dictionary includes the learning rate and number of epochs, which are automatically logged to WANDB.

2. **Logging Metrics**:

   - Inside the `track_metrics()` method, the current loss, number of modes, and diversity are logged to WANDB using `wandb.log()`.

3. **WANDB Dashboard**:

   - After running the script, the training metrics will be visualized in the WANDB dashboard. You can track the progress of training and compare different runs through WANDB’s interface.

4. **Automatic Hyperparameter Logging**:
   - Hyperparameters such as learning rate and number of epochs are logged to WANDB as part of the configuration.

This integration should make it easier to monitor and analyze the training process through WANDB. Let me know if you need any adjustments!
