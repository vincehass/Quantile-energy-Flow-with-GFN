### Explanation:

1. **Molecule Class**:

   - Represents a molecule, here simulated as a DNA sequence.
   - **`mutate()`**: Applies a random mutation to the sequence (e.g., changing one base to another).
   - **`get_representation()`**: Converts the sequence to a numerical representation, which could be one-hot encoding or any other suitable format.

2. **TFBindEnvironment Class**:

   - Simulates the environment for generating molecules (DNA sequences) for the TFBIND task.
   - **`reset()`**: Resets the environment to an initial molecule (sequence).
   - **`step()`**: Applies a mutation to the molecule and computes a reward based on a dummy binding affinity function.
   - **`compute_binding_affinity()`**: A placeholder for the actual binding affinity evaluation (which would be more complex in a real-world scenario).

3. **MoleculeGeneratorNetwork Class**:

   - A simple feed-forward neural network used for policy and flow prediction.
   - **`forward()`**: Applies a linear transformation followed by ReLU activation.

4. **DistributionalGFlowNet Class**:

   - Implements a Distributional GFlowNet to generate molecules by sampling actions (mutations) and optimizing a distributional flow function.
   - **`sample_action()`**: Samples an action (mutation) from the policy network.
   - **`compute_loss()`**: Computes a loss based on the predicted flow distribution and the observed rewards (trajectory balance loss).
   - **`train()`**: Trains the GFlowNet using the environment. The training loop generates trajectories of molecule mutations and optimizes the flow network based on the trajectory balance loss.

5. **Main Execution**:

   - Initializes the environment and agent.
   - Trains the agent to generate molecules with higher binding affinities by mutating the sequences and learning the distributional flow.
