Line-by-Line Explanation:
Imports:
torch, torch.nn, torch.optim: PyTorch modules for defining neural networks and performing optimization.
numpy: For numerical operations (used here for grid setup).
Grid Environment:
GridEnvironment class: A simple grid-based environment where the agent can move up, down, left, or right.
reset(): Resets the environment to the start state (top-left corner of the grid).
step(): Moves the agent based on the action (0: right, 1: left, 2: down, 3: up) and returns the next state, reward, and whether the terminal state (bottom-right corner) is reached.
Simple Neural Network:
SimpleNetwork class: A basic feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer, used to predict either the policy (action probabilities) or flow distribution (mean and variance).
forward(): Applies a linear transformation followed by a ReLU activation function and returns the output (logits or flow parameters).
Distributional GFlowNet Agent:
DistributionalGFlowNet class: The core agent that uses a policy network to choose actions and a flow network to model the distribution of flows through states.
get_state_representation(): Converts the grid position (x, y) into a one-hot encoded vector for neural network input.
sample_action(): Samples an action using the policy network by converting state logits into action probabilities via softmax and sampling from the resulting distribution.
compute_loss(): Computes the trajectory balance loss. This simplified version calculates the mean squared error between the reward and the predicted flow mean, regularized by the predicted variance (a form of distributional loss).
train(): The main training loop. It runs for a specified number of epochs, generating trajectories in the environment, calculating losses, and updating the network weights using gradient descent.
Main Execution:
Main block: Initializes the environment and the GFlowNet agent, then starts training. The agent explores the grid, collects trajectories, computes the distributional loss, and updates its policy and flow networks.
Summary:
This simplified version of the distributional.py script implements a basic Distributional GFlowNet agent that operates in a grid world. The agent uses neural networks to model both the policy (for action selection) and the flow function (as a distribution). The training process aims to balance the flow through the grid states and optimize the trajectory balance loss.

This script is structured to help you understand how Distributional GFlowNets work in a grid-based environment, with clear explanations for each line of code.
